hi my name is Samuel and this is my demo video for the question 2 for module 1 exam so for this code this will show two four squares red and blue check marks here in the code there are only three well three operations which is one it sets the background color to the blue and then these two set those two little squares on the corners red so first we use we set uh the ah to six which is the parameter for uh which uh yeah for the screen clearing for uh 10h and then we move al uh zero to al so make sure it doesn't interfere with uh operation and next we have this this is the video attribute here is our background color and this is our foreground color so this is set to the background color of blue right now which is 001 and then these is the upper left corner the position of the upper left corner of this this square or where the fill is the position of the fill so here the upper left corner is zero zero and then the lower right corner is 2479 which is which will take up all the space of the terminal so it's basically the same code but repeated two more times so for the other small red squares the first one has the upper left position of 0 0 and then the lower right position of 11 and by 38 and then the upper left position for the second square is 12 and 39 and the lower right is the 24 and 79 and they also do interrupt 10h so after that we call the parameter 4ch and then we interrupt 21h to terminate the program so let's compile the code So here is the code. And then as you can see, it's the same image from the question. and so uh the upper left corner it has fields uh squares that is filled with red and on the bottom right corner you have a square as well in the background square or this is the blue portion of the image is actually the whole screen but these red squares are overlaying it So, yeah, so that concludes the project demo. Thank you for watching.
